**Overview of the school district analysis**
The purpose of this analysis was to to complete a district analysis for the school board.  I have originally worked through the requests and the team was notified by the school board that there is academic dishonestly with reading and math grades for ninth graders at Thomas High School.  The school board would like to remove the reading and math grades for the ninth graders at Thomas High School and to recalculate the averages and grades after removing the untrustworthy data. 

**Results**
After working through the analysis with the updated student count after removing the ninth graders from Thomas High School, it was interesting to see how the data was affected by the academic dishonestly reporting.

- Overall, it did not change the district summary significantly.  The % passing math was decreased by almost .20% and the % passing reading was decreased by roughly .10%.
- Within the per school summary, the only one that changed was Thomas High School due to removing the 9th graders from the calculation.  The average math and reading score were affected minimually with a reduction in the overall passing percentage to 90.63% from 90.95%.
- Even with removing the 9th grader scores for Thomas High School, they still were in the top 5 schools coming in at number 2 which is the same spot they were in the original analysis.
- Replacing the math and reading scores for 9th grade at Thomas High School did not affect any of the other outcomes for the other schools or grade levels because the average scores are calculated based on their grade and the school they are at.
- Thomas High School is in the $630 - $644 spending per student so by removing the 9th grade scores and by updating the passing percentages, the district summary for math and reading scores changed slightly for the $630 - $644 spend.
- Thomas High School is considered a medium size school so again, the medicum save average and percentage scores were changed slightly due to removing the 9th grade scores.
- Thomas High School is a Charter School and with the small count of the total district, the output of average and percentages of passingw would not be affected to a large degree.
