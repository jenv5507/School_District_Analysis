**Overview of the school district analysis**
The purpose of this analysis was to to complete a district analysis for the school board.  I have originally worked through the requests and the team was notified by the school board that there is academic dishonestly with reading and math grades for ninth graders at Thomas High School.  The school board would like to remove the reading and math grades for the ninth graders at Thomas High School and to recalculate the averages and grades after removing the untrustworthy data. 

**Results**
After working through the analysis with the updated student count after removing the ninth graders from Thomas High School, it was interesting to see how the data was affected by the academic dishonestly reporting.

- Overall, it did not change the district summary significantly.  The % passing math was decreased by almost .20% and the % passing reading was decreased by roughly .10%.
- Within the per school summary, the only one that changed was Thomas High School due to removing the 9th graders from the calculation.  The average math and reading score were affected minimually with a reduction in the overall passing percentage to 90.63% from 90.95%.
- Even with removing the 9th grader scores for Thomas High School, they still were in the top 5 schools coming in at number 2 which is the same spot they were in the original analysis.
- The math and reading 
- Scores by school spending
- Scores by school size
- Scores by school type
